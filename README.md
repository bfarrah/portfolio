# About me 
My name is Benjamin Farrah, and my pronouns are he/him/his. I am in my final semester of the MISM-16 program, and will (hopefully) graduate in December 2024. I am interested in software development and hope to one day become a fulltime software engineer, or at least work somewhere within that field. I grew up in Irwin, PA, and I completed my undergraduate studies at Allegheny College in Meadville, PA. Over the summer, I worked as a software engineering intern at Coherent in Saxonburg, PA, which gave me an experience to learn new programming languages like C# and to get some real-world experience in the field I would like to enter. 

I've always been interested in computers and video games. I did a lot with modding various games in high school, so I think that's what sparked my interest in software development. At some point in my freetime, I'd like to try to develop my own game for fun. I've done a lot of programming projects for school, but I've never done much with making something for myself. This is definitely something I'd like to try at some point soon.

# What I hope to learn 
I'm hoping to learn about the most effective ways to convey information through data visualization. I've often struggled with the "so what?" aspect of data, so I want to be able to use charts and graphs to support the points I'm trying to convey. I also hope that this class will help me determine what a good chart looks like to help me in my career. There will likely be times where I'll need to convey data in a meeting through a graph, so I want to be able to create a graph that is both designed well and contextually aware of the data I am working with.

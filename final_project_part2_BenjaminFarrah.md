# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience will be parents/guardians of teenagers, but I also want to reach young people themselves through this story. I want to reach both parents and their children so that they can have meaningful and supportive conversations about smoking. For this research, I will only be interviewing parents/guardians of teenagers (in the age range of 12-18) as I don't personally know any teenagers.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Identify awareness of vape use among guardians so I know how much the average guardian knows before seeing my presentation.|"How would you describe your awareness of vaping and its popularity among teenagers?"|
|Guage how much guardians know about health risks so I can tune the depth to which I address that in my presentation.|"What do you know about health risks associated with vaping?"|
|Figure out what guardians have actually said to their kids. This will help me determine the level of care guardians have generally taken, and help me know what advice or tips could best help parents for having these conversations.|"What, if anything, have you discussed with your child about vaping and tobacco use?"|
|Determine which of my visualizations stood out, and whether it was for a good or bad reason.|"Did any visualizations in this storyboard stand out to you? Which ones, and why?"|


## Interview findings

### Interview 1 Transcript:
- "How would you describe your awareness of vaping and its popularity among teenagers?"
  - "I’ve definitely heard about it, mostly from the news and my kids’ school newsletters. They mention it during PTA meetings, but I don’t know how common it really is. My kids don’t talk about it much, but I feel like it's more common than I'd think."
- "What do you know about health risks associated with vaping?"
  - "I know it’s not as harmless as a lot of younger people think. I’ve heard that it's basically the same as smoking a cigarette if not worse, and it can cause lung damage and that there’s still nicotine, which makes it addictive."
- "What, if anything, have you discussed with your child about vaping and tobacco use?"
  - "We talked about it a little bit. I told them it’s bad for their health. I’m not sure they’d listen if I tried to make it a bigger conversation, though."
- "Did any visualizations in this storyboard stand out to you? Which ones, and why?"
  - "There was a purple bar graph that I remember seeing. I can't believe the vape companies spent so much more than that other company."

### Interview 2 Transcript:
- "How would you describe your awareness of vaping and its popularity among teenagers?"
  - "Oh, it’s everywhere. My son said that some kids vape in the bathrooms at school. I see those devices in gas stations all the time. I feel like I've got a handle on it, but that'll probably change after I see these graphs."
- "What do you know about health risks associated with vaping?"
  - "I know it’s bad for your lungs, but people at work say it’s safer than smoking. I thought people used vapes to quit smoking, so wouldn't it be better for you? I guess it's hard to know how serious the risks are." 
- "What, if anything, have you discussed with your child about vaping and tobacco use?"
  - "We’ve had a few talks. I told him not to try it because I’ve seen how hard it was for my mom to quit smoking. He seemed to take it seriously, but I don’t know what he does when he’s with friends."
- "Did any visualizations in this storyboard stand out to you? Which ones, and why?"
  - "Not really, they were all pretty decent."
 
### Interview 3 Transcript:
- "How would you describe your awareness of vaping and its popularity among teenagers?"
  - "I know it’s pretty common, especially with the older kids. My son mentioned that some of his friends vape, but I’m not sure how many other kids are doing it. I hear about it on the news and see warnings in school emails."
- "What do you know about health risks associated with vaping?"
  - "Well there's nicotine in vapes, so it’s addictive, and it causes lung problems. I wouldn't be surprised if it causes cancer like cigarettes. I dunno what else there is, though."
- "What, if anything, have you discussed with your child about vaping and tobacco use?"
  - "There was this one time when I thought that he was vaping, but really it was just his friend vaping in my basement. I told him it’s not as harmless as some people think and I don’t want him trying it, but who knows if he was listening."
- "Did any visualizations in this storyboard stand out to you? Which ones, and why?"
  - "I didn't really like the first one. It was kind of boring and hard to read. I wish it were a bit more clear or at least a bit more interesting." 

| Questions               | Interview 1 (Parent, 50s) | Interview 2 (Parent, 30s) | Interview 3 (Parent, 50s) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|"How would you describe your awareness of vaping and its popularity among teenagers?"|Parents may have only heard about it without actually knowing much at all about it.|Parents may just assume that it's extremely common.|Parents may have had direct or indirect experience with it through their children or their friends.|
|"What do you know about health risks associated with vaping?"|Some parents are aware of the dangers, but don't know much beyond that it's addictive and it's similar to a cigarette.|Some parents may think vaping is just a way for people to quit smoking cigarettes, since that's how it originated.|Parents are generally aware that vapes are addictive, but they aren't sure about other risks beyond that.|
|"What, if anything, have you discussed with your child about vaping and tobacco use?"|Some parents may not try very hard to have conversations with their kids. They may feel some kind of disconnect preventing them from listening to one another.|Parents who've had personal experience may be more comfortable with the topic, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're more knowledgeable about it.|Some parents seem discouraged or possibly hopeless.|
|"Did any visualizations in this storyboard stand out to you? Which ones, and why?"|The advertisement spend graph is impactfuls. Talking about things in dollar amounts is a reliable path to making something relatable.|There may not be any graph that really stands out, or they may all be a little bit boring.|The first line graph isn't good at catching people's attention. In fact, it may do the opposite and be too boring or bland.|


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Parents/guardians have a wide variety of baseline knowledge about vaping.|I should change mhy introduction to cover basic information about vaping, including how common it is. This could be articulated by stating the average number of students per grade that use vapes, perhaps.|
|Some of my visualizations, especially the first one, seem a bit boring or don't convey the point well enough.|I should find ways to include graphs that seem more visualy exciting, which will make the users more engaged and possibly more likely to learn.|
|There's a wide variety of comfort parents feel in discussing this with their children.|I could include more tips about how to actually have these conversations. I could include points detailing what would make the conversation constructive and what could make it more damaging. In general, I should provide a guide to making this an easy topic to talk about.|
|Parents only know the surface-level risks associated with vaping, like addiction or being more likely to use tobacco products.|I should look more into other risks of vaping. I could talk more about direct risks like cancer, or maybe more risks to mental health. It seems that parents are only focusing on the physical health side, so I could inform them more of how vapes can impact their children psychologically.|

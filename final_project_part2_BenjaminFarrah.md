# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience will be parents/guardians of teenagers, but I also want to reach young people themselves through this story. I want to reach both parents and their children so that they can have meaningful and supportive conversations about smoking. For this research, I will only be interviewing parents/guardians of teenagers (in the age range of 12-18) as I don't personally know any teenagers.

# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

After completing Part II, I decided to only keep the visualizations I had already finished making. I got rid of the handdrawn drafts because I couldn't get access to datasets to help me make those graphs. The points I was making were still supported by individual data points and other visualizations I found online, but the raw data was often not publically accessible.

From the interviews, I found out that some parents may not know a lot about what vapes are and about potential health consequences it may have. I added an introduction which briefly goes over what a vape is and a little bit of history about them, specifically about how they were initially intended to help people quit smoking. I also made general changes to the layout and design of it, which included adding more pictures and having standalone title slides which make the document look more professional.

I wanted to refocus one aspect of my story to show how certain corporations profit from addiction and delibrately advertise to minors, and to make sure that I'm not putting any blame on the kids themselves. I tried to make this a bigger part of my story because that's more aligned with my own core values. I'm not against smoking or vaping at all, I just wanted my story to show parents the malicious power of e-cigarette companies and give them guidance on how to talk to their kids about this. That helped me redesign my call to action to have more emphasis on having an honest conversation about it with their kids rather than trying to blame or scare them.

# Changes made since Part II

After completing Part II, I decided to only keep the visualizations I had already finished making. I got rid of the handdrawn drafts because I couldn't get access to datasets to help me make those graphs. The points I was making were still supported by individual data points and other visualizations I found online, but the raw data was often not publically accessible.

From the interviews, I found out that some parents may not know a lot about what vapes are and about potential health consequences it may have. I added an introduction which briefly goes over what a vape is and a little bit of history about them, specifically about how they were initially intended to help people quit smoking. I also made general changes to the layout and design of it, which included adding more pictures and having standalone title slides which make the document look more professional. I opted to go for a generally darker theme to both underline the dangers of smoking and the sleek-black design of Juuls. I also thought this may remind people of cigarette ash, so I wanted to create that association. In the middle section, I chose lighter pastel colors to align with the bright and teen-oriented marketing used by e-cigarette companies. I tried to keep the colors muted, though, to keep the grim/serious undertones intact. On the slide about marketing spending, I specifically chose a green theme to create a mental image of corporate greed. I actually use shorthand's color-picker tool to use the same shade of green from the image of money.

I wanted to refocus one aspect of my story to show how certain corporations profit from addiction and delibrately advertise to minors, and to make sure that I'm not putting any blame on the kids themselves. I tried to make this a bigger part of my story because that's more aligned with my own core values. I'm not against smoking or vaping at all, I just wanted my story to show parents the malicious power of e-cigarette companies and give them guidance on how to talk to their kids about this. That helped me redesign my call to action to have more emphasis on having an honest conversation about it with their kids rather than trying to blame or scare them.

## The audience

My audience was specicially parents/guardians of teenagers. From my interviews, it seemed like parents needed a lot of help on this subject. They tended to not have a lot of information about potential dangers of vaping or about how different vapes are from cigarettes. They also seemed a little misguided in having conversations about it with their kids, even sometimes avoiding the subject. They weren't aware of the predatory marketing taking place in the e-cigarette industry. I wanted to highlight how vaping isn't the fault of the teenagers who try it, and to encourage parents to have thoughtful and supportive conversations with their children about it.

# Final thoughts

I think this project went pretty well overall. It was an interesting process to research this topic and develop this story. I wish I had done more with the visualizations, though. I thought my bar chart about marketing spending was particularly impactful, but the others were a little boring. This is partly due to the limited datasets I was able to find, and not having a great understanding of how to do more in tools like Tableau. I also would have liked to go more into the corporate-greed aspect of it, researching things like Juul's profits and how the cigarette industry is affected by e-cigarettes. I could have also looked into strategies taken by anti-smoking campaigns and whether their strategies have actually been impactful against vaping.

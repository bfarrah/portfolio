I chose this visualization because it seemed like it had a strong foundation and potential to show something important, but relied too much on jargon and became unclear. Specifically, the big block of text underneath the chart caught my attention. I became even more confused after reading it, and I only understood the difference between "realized" and "granted" compensation after some Googling. It also seemed a bit bland or boring to look at. This graph definitely seemed like it had a story to tell (CEO's having much more compensation than average workers) but wasn't easy enough to read so as to share that story beyond business-oriented individuals.
